Explorer Mode

Create a website for a fictional restaurant that allows customers to place orders online.
Display the menu by using the provided api (see Notes section)
A customer should be able to add an item to their order by clicking on the item's name in the menu. Alternatively, you can create a button on each menu item that says "add to order"
Display the total for the customer, and include tax at 8%.
When the customer clicks the order now button, you should save their order to a tiny-za-server endpoint
After submitting their order the customer should be taken to a confirmation screen displaying their order and the total due (no wireframe provided).
